# The volume group to use for docker storage.  Defaults to the
# volume group where the root filesystem resides.  If VG is specified and the

# The desired size for the docker data LV.  It defaults using 60% of all
# free space.
#
# DATA_SIZE can take values acceptable to "lvcreate -L" as well as some
# values acceptable to to "lvcreate -l". If user intends to pass values
# acceptable to "lvcreate -l", then only those values which contains "%"

# Value should be a number followed by a optional suffix. "bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE"
# are valid suffixes. If no suffix is specified then value will be considered
# as mebibyte unit.
#
# Both upper and lower case suffix represent same unit of size. Use suffix B
# for Bytes, S for sectors as 512 bytes, K for kibibytes (1024 bytes), M for

# Wipe any signatures (partition, filesystem, lvm etc) found on disk.
# This could mean wiping the signature explicitly or using force options
# of various commands to wipe/overwrite signatures. By default signatures

# by setting WIPE_SIGNATURES=true. Be careful before using this option
# as this means if there was any leftover data on disk, it will be lost.
