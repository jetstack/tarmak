Tarmak documentation
====================

Tarmak is an open-source toolkit for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management. It is focused on
best-practice cluster security, management and operation.

Tarmak's underlying components are the product of Jetstack_'s work with its customers to 
build and deploy Kubernetes in production at scale.

.. note::
   Please note that current releases of Tarmak are *alpha* (unless explicitly marked). 
   Although we do not anticipate breaking changes, at this stage this cannot be absolutely guaranteed.
